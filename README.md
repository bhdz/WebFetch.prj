Hello this Project Strives to provide wget like (+ &plus; additions) like
 functionality to the Python Standard Library (3.0 >, sorry).

It includes DEAMONS, BOTS (that operate on Daemons), and OTHER GOODIES (like
  fstools and just a FETCHER LIBRARY). It Strives to be Pythonic as possible
  (canonical OOP, without too much functional idioms) and to be with Batteries
  included. The Hierarchy is FLAT and most of the CLASSES are FOUNDATIONAL,
  leaving you, the USER with AS MUCH SPACE TO EXPERIMENT AS POSSIBLE.

Enjoy!
